# orangeStartpage

This is my first startpage. I made it responsive using bootstrap. 

## Fonts
The fonts used are Font Awesome for the icons and NovaMono for the text.

## Search bar
The search bar supports multiple search engines: select what you prefer from the dropdown menu.
If you want to add your own search engine, add an element to "engines" array at the top of scripts/startPage.js.

## Icon links
To add or remove an icon link, you must edit startPage.js manually for now. I'll make it more easy in the future.
